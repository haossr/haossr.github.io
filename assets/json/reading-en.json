The result was inevitably a discrepancy between words and intentions. Anyone who grew up in an old-style Chinese family understands how the will of the head of the household, while seemingly unchallenged on the surface, was in fact distorted. In such a situation, hypocrisy was not only unavoidable but also necessary. For dogmas or orders that could not be opposed yet were impractical, the only option was to distort them, leaving only a façade. This façade was the appearance of non-opposition. The distance between name and reality increased along with the pace of social change.",

Compared with many linguistic features that are easily influenced and altered by external factors, in the vast majority of cases when two speakers of Chinese converse, even if their dialects differ somewhat in how they distribute retroflex and non-retroflex sounds, it is almost impossible for this to create a communication barrier. In fact, if one does not listen very carefully, one often will not even notice that the sets of characters pronounced with retroflex versus non-retroflex sounds differ between the two sides. Therefore, relatively few people will change the distribution of retroflex and non-retroflex sounds in their own accent just because the other person’s way of speaking is considered more prestigious. Thanks to this, although today the dialects of northern Ningxia, represented by the Yinchuan dialect, already sound strongly northwestern, a closer examination of retroflex and non-retroflex sounds still allows us to trace their origins.",
